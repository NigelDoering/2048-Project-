For this programming assignment I had to make the computer read a file and 
find the how many times each word occurs and save that word and it's
count of how many times it occurred.

Inside WordCountList.java I create various commands. The first is to read a
file and mark how many times each word occurred and to save these words into
something called a WordCount. Next I removed the common words from that list.
Then I had to print out that list of words and their count and finally I had
to find out the top most occurring words in the list. 

Inside the file WordCountListTester.java is a bunch of tests I wrote for the
commands inside WordCountList.java. These tests made sure that the commands 
inside WordCount.java were operating correctly. It was strange at first trying
to approach a command from the opposite direction and trying to write
a test for it. I really struggled, but after about the second test it got much 
easier and faster to write the tests.
