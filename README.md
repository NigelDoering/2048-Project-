Description: Files needed to create the 2048 game. Primary code is found written in Board.java, Gui2048.java, and GameManager.java. Board.java makes up the majority of the backend of the program, while Gui2048.java is the front end written using javafx. 

Warning: This project was done a while ago so my style may not be the greatest.

Acknowlegment: Small parts of starter code was provided by UCSD CSE8B class instructors.
